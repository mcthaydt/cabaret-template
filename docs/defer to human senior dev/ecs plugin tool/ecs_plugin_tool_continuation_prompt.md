# ECS Debugger Plugin – Continuation Status

## Project On Hold (2025-10-23)

The ECS debugger plugin effort was rolled back and formally de-scoped. **Do not resume implementation** unless leadership explicitly reactivates the project.

If the initiative is revived:

1. Re-read the quick guidance docs (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/general/DEV_PITFALLS.md`, `docs/general/STYLE_GUIDE.md`).
2. Review historical planning material and the cancellation notes:
   - `docs/ecs plugin tool/ecs_plugin_tool_plan.md` (archived roadmap)
   - `docs/ecs plugin tool/ecs_plugin_tool_prd.md` (requirements)
   - `docs/ecs plugin tool/ecs_plugin_tool_architecture.md` (reference design)
   - `docs/ecs/ecs_refactor_plan.md` (Batch 4 Step 2 decision log)
3. Confirm the scope and expectations with the team before writing any code.
