## Required Readings

Before making any changes, read these in order:

1. `docs/qb_rule_manager/qb-v2-overview.md` — full architecture (the source of truth)
2. `docs/qb_rule_manager/qb-v2-plan.md` — phased implementation plan
3. `docs/qb_rule_manager/qb-v2-tasks.md` — task checklist (track progress here)
4. `AGENTS.md` — project conventions, naming, testing patterns (will be updated in Phase 5)
5. `docs/general/DEV_PITFALLS.md` — GDScript pitfalls and testing patterns
6. `docs/general/STYLE_GUIDE.md` — prefix conventions

## Architecture Summary (Quick Reference)

**Core change:** The rule engine is a stateless scoring library (two functions), not an ECS base class.

**Layer 1 — Data (Resources):**
- `RS_Rule` — conditions/effects arrays + metadata (currently `Array[Resource]` fallback in headless; validator enforces expected subtypes)
- 5 condition subclasses: ComponentField, ReduxField, EntityTag, EventPayload, Constant
- 4 effect subclasses: DispatchAction, PublishEvent, SetField, SetContextValue
- Typed arrays are planned; headless currently uses `Array[Resource]` fallback with runtime validation

**Layer 2 — Engine (Pure functions):**
- `U_RuleScorer.score_rules(rules, context) → Array[{rule, score}]`
- `U_RuleSelector.select_winners(scored) → Array[{rule, score}]`
- Scoring: per-condition evaluate() → response_curve → invert → multiplicative product → threshold filter
- Selection: partition by decision_group, ungrouped fire independently, grouped pick best (score → priority → rule_id)

**Layer 3 — State tracking (Opt-in):**
- `RuleStateTracker` — cooldowns, rising edge, one-shot. Each consumer creates its own instance.

**Consumers compose the library:**
```gdscript
var context := _build_my_context()
var scored := U_RuleScorer.score_rules(_rules, context)
var winners := U_RuleSelector.select_winners(scored)
_handle_winners(winners, context)  # domain-specific
```

**Key v2 improvements over v1:**
- Typed condition/effect subclasses (no enum soup, no Dictionary payloads)
- `RS_EffectSetField.use_context_value` — dynamic effect values read from context
- `@export var rules: Array[RS_Rule]` on domain systems — designers add rules without editing code
- `S_GameEventSystem` supports global tick context (v1 had no tick capability)
- No 632-line base class to inherit from

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 2A:** Delete v1 QB engine files/tests/resources (T132-T144), then grep for stale references before migration work.
2. Work through phases sequentially — each ends with a commit checkpoint.
3. Do NOT touch v1 code until Phase 2A (delete step).

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Everything is a score.** No separate boolean evaluation. Binary conditions return 0.0 or 1.0. Multiplicative product handles AND.
2. **No method-call fallback.** `U_PathResolver` uses `get()` for Object property access, never `has_method()` + call. Avoids accidental side effects.
3. **Effects are optional.** Some future consumers (AI, dialogue) interpret winning rule identity rather than executing effects. Effects are on the rule but consumers choose whether to execute them.
4. **Handler systems unchanged.** `S_CheckpointHandlerSystem`, `S_VictoryHandlerSystem`, `S_DeathHandlerSystem` subscribe to ECS events. They have zero coupling to rule engine internals and are NOT modified.
5. **Context is a plain Dictionary.** No typed context class. Keys are documented per domain. Conditions resolve paths within it. Effects write to it.
6. **One tracker per consumer.** `RuleStateTracker` instances are not shared. Each domain system manages its own cooldown/rising-edge/one-shot state.
7. **Renamed systems reflect actual responsibility:** `S_CharacterStateSystem` (brain data), `S_GameEventSystem` (event routing), `S_CameraStateSystem` (camera behavior). Not "rule managers."

```

## GDScript Pitfalls (Relevant to v2)

- `tr` cannot be a method name — collides with `Object.tr()`. Use `localize()` or similar.
- `String(value)` fails for arbitrary Variants — use `str(value)`.
- Inner class names must start with a capital letter.
- Typed arrays with Resource subclasses: verify inspector dropdown behavior in Phase 1D before proceeding.
- `@export var conditions: Array[RS_BaseCondition]` — Godot 4.x supports this and shows a subclass picker. If it doesn't work as expected, fall back to `Array[Resource]` with runtime type checks.

## Outstanding Risks

- **Typed Resource arrays in inspector:** Godot 4.6 should support `Array[RS_BaseCondition]` with subclass dropdown. Verify in Phase 1D (T79-T80) before building all resources on this assumption.
- **Scene references after rename:** `.tscn` files referencing old script paths (`s_character_rule_manager.gd`) need updating. Grep all scenes in Phases 2-4.
- **v1 test deletion scope:** Phase 2A deletes v1 tests. Ensure v2 tests from Phase 1 are in separate files that won't be caught in the deletion.
