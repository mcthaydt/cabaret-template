# ECS Refactor – Continuation Prompt

## ✅ Refactor Status: COMPLETE (2025-12-08)

The ECS architecture refactor has been successfully delivered. All planned work is complete except for the ECS debugger tooling (de-scoped 2025-10-23).

### What Was Delivered

**Batch 1 - Code Quality Refactors**: ✅ Complete
- Centralized utilities (`U_ECSUtils`)
- Settings validation (`_validate_required_settings()`)
- Null filtering in manager

**Batch 2 - Multi-Component Query System**: ✅ Complete
- `U_EntityQuery` class
- `M_ECSManager.query_entities()` with required/optional filters
- Query caching (<1ms performance)

**Batch 3 - Event Bus + Component Decoupling**: ✅ Complete
- `U_ECSEventBus` static singleton
- Event history buffer (1000 events)
- All component-to-component NodePaths removed

**Batch 4 - System Ordering + Polish**: ✅ Complete
- `execution_priority` on systems (0-1000)
- Manager-driven physics processing
- Priority conventions documented

### Current State

- **Test Coverage**: 55/55 tests passing (47 unit + 8 integration)
- **Performance**: <1ms query time, <0.5ms event dispatch at 60fps
- **Decoupling**: Zero NodePath cross-references between components
- **Emergent Gameplay**: Working (jump → particles + sound + camera shake)

### Key Implementation Files

- `scripts/utils/u_ecs_utils.gd` - Shared helpers (manager, time, body mapping, cross-tree references)
- `scripts/managers/m_ecs_manager.gd` - Entity queries, component tracking, priority-sorted execution
- `scripts/ecs/base_ecs_system.gd` - Execution priority, query passthrough
- `scripts/ecs/u_entity_query.gd` - Multi-component query results
- `scripts/ecs/u_ecs_event_bus.gd` - Static event pub/sub
- All systems in `scripts/ecs/systems/` - Use `query_entities()` instead of NodePaths
- All components in `scripts/ecs/components/` - No component→component NodePaths

### Future Work (Deferred)

- **ECS Debugger Tooling**: De-scoped after failed attempt (2025-10-23)
  - Not critical for core functionality
  - Revisit only if project direction changes

### For Future Contributors

When working with the ECS architecture:

1. **Read core docs**:
   - `docs/ecs/ecs_architecture.md` - Full technical reference
   - `docs/ecs/ecs_ELI5.md` - Friendly introduction
   - `AGENTS.md` - Project conventions

2. **Use query-based patterns**:
   - Call `query_entities([required_types], [optional_types])` in systems
   - Never add NodePath cross-references between components
   - Use `U_ECSEventBus.publish()` for cross-system communication

3. **Follow priority conventions**:
   - Input systems: 0-9
   - Core motion: 40-69
   - Feedback/VFX: 110-199

4. **Test first**:
   - All system tests drive execution via `manager._physics_process()`
   - Entity roots must use `E_*` prefix for query system

Happy coding!
