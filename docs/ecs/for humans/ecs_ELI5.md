## What Is It? (The Simple Version)

Imagine you're building with LEGO blocks. Instead of having one giant block for each toy (a "car block", a "plane block"), you have lots of small pieces that you can mix and match:

- **Wheels** (a piece)
- **Wings** (a piece)
- **Engine** (a piece)
- **Seat** (a piece)

You can combine these pieces to make different things:
- Car = Wheels + Engine + Seat
- Plane = Wings + Engine + Seat
- Boat = Engine + Seat (no wheels or wings!)

**ECS works the same way!**

Instead of one giant "Player" script with all the code, you have small pieces:
- **Components** = LEGO pieces (data: velocity, jump_height, input)
- **Systems** = The instructions (how to move, how to jump, how to float)
- **Entities** = The complete toy (your player, enemies, objects)
- **M_ECSManager** = The LEGO instruction booklet (keeps track of all pieces)

---

## The Big Picture

```
Your Game
├─ M_ECSManager ← The LEGO Instruction Book (tracks all pieces)
│
├─ Player (Entity) ← The Complete Toy
│  ├─ C_MovementComponent ← Wheels (can move)
│  ├─ C_InputComponent ← Remote Control (player controls it)
│  ├─ C_JumpComponent ← Springs (can jump)
│  └─ C_FloatingComponent ← Balloons (can float)
│
└─ Systems ← The Instructions
   ├─ S_InputSystem ← Reads the remote control
   ├─ S_MovementSystem ← Makes the wheels turn
   ├─ S_JumpSystem ← Makes the springs bounce
   └─ S_FloatingSystem ← Makes the balloons float
```

Every frame (60 times per second):
1. **S_InputSystem** reads your controller
2. **S_MovementSystem** moves your character
3. **S_JumpSystem** makes you jump
4. **S_FloatingSystem** makes you hover

---

## The Key Players

### 1. M_ECSManager - The Instruction Book

Think of this as the **master instruction booklet** that knows where all your LEGO pieces are.

**What it does:**
- Keeps a list of all components (pieces)
- Helps systems find the pieces they need
- Makes sure pieces register when added
- Makes sure pieces unregister when removed

**Where it lives:** `scripts/managers/m_ecs_manager.gd`

**How to find it:**
```gdscript
# Components automatically find it when they're added to the scene
# You don't usually need to find it manually
```

### 2. Components - The LEGO Pieces

Components are like **individual LEGO pieces**. Each piece stores information but doesn't do anything on its own.

**Examples:**

**C_MovementComponent** (Wheels):
```gdscript
@export var velocity: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO  # How fast am I moving?
@export var max_speed: float = 5.0           # What's my top speed?
@export var acceleration: float = 50.0       # How quickly do I speed up?
```

**C_InputComponent** (Remote Control):
```gdscript
@export var input_vector: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO  # Which direction is player pressing?
@export var jump_pressed: bool = false            # Is player holding jump?
```

**C_JumpComponent** (Springs):
```gdscript
@export var jump_velocity: float = 5.0  # How high can I jump?
@export var coyote_time: float = 0.1    # How long can I jump after leaving ground?
```

**C_FloatingComponent** (Balloons):
```gdscript
@export var floating_enabled: bool = true     # Am I floating right now?
@export var floating_height: float = 1.0      # How high should I hover?
@export var floating_spring_strength: float = 10.0  # How strong is the float?
```

**Where they live:** `scripts/ecs/components/`

### 3. Systems - The Instructions

Systems are like **instruction manuals**. They tell the pieces what to do.

**Example: S_MovementSystem** (How to Make Wheels Turn)

```gdscript
# Every frame, this system:
# 1. Finds all movement components (wheels)
# 2. Finds all input components (remote controls)
# 3. Makes the wheels turn based on the remote control

func process_tick(delta: float):
    # Find all the wheels
    var movement_components = get_components("C_MovementComponent")

    for movement_comp in movement_components:
        # Find the matching remote control
        var input_comp = movement_comp.get_input_component()

        # If player is pressing right on the remote...
        if input_comp.input_vector.x > 0:
            # Make the wheels turn right
            movement_comp.velocity.x = movement_comp.max_speed
```

**Where they live:** `scripts/ecs/systems/`

### 4. Entities - The Complete Toys

Entities are like **complete toys** made from multiple pieces.

**Example: Player Entity**
```
Player (CharacterBody3D) ← This is the base toy
├─ C_MovementComponent ← Add wheels
├─ C_InputComponent ← Add remote control
├─ C_JumpComponent ← Add springs
└─ C_FloatingComponent ← Add balloons

Result: A toy that can move, jump, and float!
```

**In Godot's scene tree:**
```
CharacterBody3D (Player)
├─ C_MovementComponent (Node child)
├─ C_InputComponent (Node child)
├─ C_JumpComponent (Node child)
└─ C_FloatingComponent (Node child)
```

## How It Works (Step By Step)

Let's follow what happens when you press the jump button:

### Step 1: Scene Loads

```gdscript
# When you start the game:

[1] M_ECSManager appears → "I'm the instruction book!"
[2] Player entity appears → "I'm a toy!"
[3] C_JumpComponent appears → "I'm the springs! Let me register..."
[4] C_JumpComponent finds M_ECSManager → "Found the instruction book!"
[5] C_JumpComponent registers → "Instruction book, please remember me!"
[6] M_ECSManager adds to list → "Okay, I've got one C_JumpComponent"
```

### Step 2: You Press Jump

```gdscript
# Your controller sends a jump signal

[1] S_InputSystem.process_tick() runs
[2] S_InputSystem checks: Input.is_action_just_pressed("jump") → TRUE
[3] S_InputSystem finds all C_InputComponents
[4] S_InputSystem writes: input_comp.jump_pressed = true
```

### Step 3: Jump System Processes

```gdscript
# S_JumpSystem runs (every physics frame)

[1] S_JumpSystem asks manager: "Give me all C_JumpComponents"
[2] Manager responds: "Here's one!" (your player's jump component)
[3] S_JumpSystem asks jump component: "Where's your input component?"
[4] Jump component responds: "Here!" (points to C_InputComponent)
[5] S_JumpSystem checks: input_comp.jump_pressed == true → YES!
[6] S_JumpSystem checks: "Are you on the ground?" → YES!
[7] S_JumpSystem applies: body.velocity.y = jump_velocity (5.0)
[8] Result: Your character jumps!
```

### Step 4: Gravity Takes Over

```gdscript
# S_GravitySystem runs next

[1] S_GravitySystem asks manager: "Give me all C_MovementComponents"
[2] Manager responds: "Here's one!" (your player's movement component)
[3] S_GravitySystem checks: "Is this entity floating?"
[4] If NOT floating:
    S_GravitySystem applies: velocity.y += GRAVITY * delta
[5] Result: Gravity pulls you back down
```

**Visual Flow:**
```
You press jump button
        ↓
S_InputSystem detects press
        ↓
S_InputSystem writes: input_comp.jump_pressed = true
        ↓
S_JumpSystem reads: input_comp.jump_pressed
        ↓
S_JumpSystem checks: on ground? → Yes
        ↓
S_JumpSystem applies: body.velocity.y = 5.0
        ↓
Character flies upward!
        ↓
S_GravitySystem applies: velocity.y += GRAVITY
        ↓
Character falls back down
```

## Why We Use It (The Benefits)

### 1. Mix and Match Like LEGO

**Without ECS** (one giant block):
```gdscript
# player.gd - 1000 lines of code
func _ready():
    # Movement code
    # Jump code
    # Float code
    # Input code
    # All mixed together!
```

**With ECS** (small pieces):
```gdscript
# c_movement_component.gd - 50 lines
# c_jump_component.gd - 30 lines
# c_floating_component.gd - 40 lines
# c_input_component.gd - 20 lines

# Want a floating enemy that can't jump?
# Just use: Movement + Floating (no Jump component!)

# Want a player that can jump but not float?
# Just use: Movement + Jump + Input (no Floating component!)
```

### 2. Easy to Test

**Without ECS:**
```gdscript
# To test jumping, you need the entire player script
# That means you need movement, input, floating, everything!
```

**With ECS:**
```gdscript
# To test jumping, you only need:
# - C_JumpComponent (the piece)
# - S_JumpSystem (the instructions)
# That's it! Much simpler!
```

### 3. Easy to Change

**Want to change how jumping works?**

**Without ECS:** Find the jump code buried in 1000-line player.gd file

**With ECS:** Open `s_jump_system.gd` (100 lines), change the logic

### 4. Easy to Add Features

**Want to add wall-climbing?**

**Without ECS:** Modify player script, risk breaking existing features

**With ECS:**
1. Create `C_WallClimbComponent` (stores wall-climb data)
2. Create `S_WallClimbSystem` (handles wall-climb logic)
3. Add component to player in scene
4. Done! No existing code modified!

### 5. Easy to Remove Features

**Want to remove floating?**

**Without ECS:** Comment out code, hope you didn't break anything

**With ECS:** Delete `C_FloatingComponent` from player entity. Done!

## Common Patterns (How to Actually Use It)

### Pattern 1: Creating a New Component

**Step 1: Create the file**
```gdscript
# scripts/ecs/components/c_my_new_component.gd
extends ECSComponent
class_name C_MyNewComponent

const COMPONENT_TYPE := StringName("C_MyNewComponent")

# Add your data here
@export var my_value: float = 10.0
@export var my_enabled: bool = true
```

**Step 2: Add to scene**
1. Open your player scene
2. Right-click on CharacterBody3D → "Add Child Node"
3. Search for "Node" → Add
4. Attach script: `c_my_new_component.gd`
5. Set properties in inspector

**Step 3: Component automatically registers!**
```gdscript
# This happens automatically when scene loads:
# - Component finds M_ECSManager
# - Component registers with manager
# - Systems can now query for it
```

### Pattern 2: Creating a New System

**Step 1: Create the file**
```gdscript
# scripts/ecs/systems/s_my_new_system.gd
extends ECSSystem
class_name S_MyNewSystem

func process_tick(delta: float) -> void:
    # Find all components of your type
    var my_components = get_components(C_MyNewComponent.COMPONENT_TYPE)

    # Process each component
    for component in my_components:
        if component == null:
            continue

        # Do something with the component
        if component.my_enabled:
            component.my_value += 1.0 * delta
```

**Step 2: Add to scene**
1. Add S_MyNewSystem node to your main scene (anywhere in tree)
2. System automatically finds manager
3. System can now query components!

### Pattern 3: Components Finding Each Other

**Current Pattern** (uses NodePaths):
```gdscript
# In C_MovementComponent
@export_node_path("Node") var input_component_path: NodePath

func get_input_component() -> C_InputComponent:
    if input_component_path.is_empty():
        return null
    return get_node_or_null(input_component_path) as C_InputComponent
```

**In the inspector:**
1. Click on `input_component_path`
2. Click "Assign" button
3. Select the C_InputComponent node
4. Done!

**In systems:**
```gdscript
# S_MovementSystem can now use this
var movement_comp = # ... found from manager
var input_comp = movement_comp.get_input_component()

if input_comp != null:
    # Use input to move
    movement_comp.velocity = input_comp.input_vector * movement_comp.max_speed
```

### Pattern 4: Settings Resources

**Step 1: Create a settings resource**
```gdscript
# scripts/ecs/components/floating_settings.gd
extends Resource
class_name FloatingSettings

@export var height: float = 1.0
@export var spring_strength: float = 10.0
@export var damping: float = 0.5
```

**Step 2: Use in component**
```gdscript
# In C_FloatingComponent
@export var settings: FloatingSettings

func _ready():
    super._ready()  # Register with manager
    if settings:
        floating_height = settings.height
        floating_spring_strength = settings.spring_strength
```

**Step 3: Create .tres file**
1. Right-click in FileSystem → "New Resource"
2. Search for "FloatingSettings"
3. Set values in inspector
4. Save as "floating_settings.tres"
5. Drag .tres file to component's `settings` property

## Mental Models (Ways to Think About It)

### The Factory Floor Analogy

- **Entities** = Products being assembled (cars on assembly line)
- **Components** = Parts attached to products (wheels, engine, steering wheel)
- **M_ECSManager** = Factory inventory system (knows where all parts are)
- **Systems** = Assembly stations (Station 1: attach wheels, Station 2: install engine)

When a car (entity) moves through the factory:
1. Station 1 (S_InputSystem) reads the blueprint (input)
2. Station 2 (S_MovementSystem) attaches wheels and makes it move
3. Station 3 (S_JumpSystem) installs the suspension for jumping
4. Station 4 (S_FloatingSystem) adds hover technology

Each station only works on its specific parts. If a car doesn't have wheels (no C_MovementComponent), Station 2 skips it!

### The Orchestra Analogy

- **Entities** = Musicians (violinists, drummers, pianists)
- **Components** = Instruments (violin, drums, piano)
- **M_ECSManager** = Sheet music stand (everyone knows where to look)
- **Systems** = Conductors (one for strings, one for percussion, one for keys)

When the symphony plays:
1. String Conductor (S_MovementSystem) tells all violinists (movement components) to play
2. Percussion Conductor (S_JumpSystem) tells all drummers (jump components) to play
3. Keys Conductor (S_FloatingSystem) tells all pianists (floating components) to play

Each conductor only conducts their section. If there are no drums (no C_JumpComponent), the percussion conductor has nothing to conduct!

### The Restaurant Kitchen Analogy

- **Entities** = Orders (burger, salad, soup)
- **Components** = Ingredients on each order (bun, lettuce, tomato)
- **M_ECSManager** = Order ticket system (all orders visible to staff)
- **Systems** = Kitchen stations (grill, salad bar, soup station)

When an order comes in:
1. Prep Station (S_InputSystem) reads the order
2. Grill Station (S_MovementSystem) cooks items that need cooking
3. Salad Bar (S_JumpSystem) adds vegetables
4. Soup Station (S_FloatingSystem) prepares soup

Each station only processes orders with their ingredients. If an order has no lettuce (no C_JumpComponent), Salad Bar skips it!

## The Golden Rules

### Rule 1: Components Are Data Only

**BAD:**
```gdscript
# In component - NO GAME LOGIC!
func process_tick(delta):
    velocity.y += GRAVITY * delta  # This is logic, belongs in system!
```

**GOOD:**
```gdscript
# In component - ONLY DATA!
@export var velocity: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO
@export var max_speed: float = 5.0

# In system - LOGIC GOES HERE!
func process_tick(delta):
    var movement_components = get_components(C_MovementComponent.COMPONENT_TYPE)
    for comp in movement_components:
        comp.velocity.y += GRAVITY * delta
```

**Why?** Because:
- Systems can be turned on/off independently
- Multiple systems can read same component data
- Easier to test (components are just data containers)
- Clearer separation of concerns

### Rule 2: Systems Are Stateless

**BAD:**
```gdscript
# In system - DON'T STORE STATE!
var accumulated_velocity: float = 0.0  # This breaks the pattern!

func process_tick(delta):
    accumulated_velocity += delta  # State in system = bad!
```

**GOOD:**
```gdscript
# Store state in components instead!
# In C_MovementComponent:
var accumulated_velocity: float = 0.0

# In S_MovementSystem:
func process_tick(delta):
    var components = get_components(C_MovementComponent.COMPONENT_TYPE)
    for comp in components:
        comp.accumulated_velocity += delta  # State in component = good!
```

**Why?** Because:
- Systems just process data
- All state lives in components
- Systems can be added/removed without losing state
- Multiple entities can use same system

### Rule 3: Components Register Automatically

**You DON'T need to do this:**
```gdscript
# In component - DON'T MANUALLY REGISTER!
func _ready():
    var manager = find_manager_somehow()
    manager.register_component(self)  # You don't need this!
```

**It happens automatically:**
```gdscript
# In ECSComponent base class (already done for you):
func _ready():
    _manager = _locate_manager()  # Finds manager automatically
    if _manager:
        _manager.register_component(self)  # Registers automatically
```

**Just add component to scene, and it registers itself!**

### Rule 4: One M_ECSManager Per Scene

There should only be ONE manager in your scene.

```gdscript
# M_ECSManager checks this automatically:
func _ready():
    var existing = get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("ecs_manager")
    if existing.size() > 1:
        push_error("Multiple M_ECSManager instances found!")
        queue_free()  # Remove duplicate
```

**Why?** Because:
- One source of truth for all components
- Avoids confusion (which manager has my component?)
- Simpler to reason about

### Rule 5: Systems Query Every Frame

**Pattern:**
```gdscript
# Systems query components EVERY frame
func process_tick(delta: float):
    var components = get_components(C_MovementComponent.COMPONENT_TYPE)
    # Process components...
```

**Don't cache component arrays:**
```gdscript
# BAD - Don't do this!
var cached_components: Array = []

func _ready():
    cached_components = get_components(C_MovementComponent.COMPONENT_TYPE)

func process_tick(delta):
    for comp in cached_components:  # Components might be added/removed!
        # This can break if components change
```

**Why?** Because:
- Components can be added/removed at runtime
- Querying is fast (Dictionary lookup)
- Always get up-to-date component list

---

## Quick Reference

### How to Get the Manager

```gdscript
# You usually don't need to - components/systems find it automatically!
# But if you do:
var manager = get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("ecs_manager")[0]
```

### How to Query Components

```gdscript
# In a system:
var movement_components = get_components(C_MovementComponent.COMPONENT_TYPE)

for component in movement_components:
    if component == null:
        continue
    # Use component...
```

### How to Access Component Data

```gdscript
# In a system:
var component = # ... found from manager

# Read data
var current_velocity = component.velocity

# Write data
component.velocity = Vector3(1, 0, 0)
```

### How to Find Related Components

```gdscript
# In a system:
var movement_comp = # ... found from manager
var input_comp = movement_comp.get_input_component()

if input_comp != null:
    # Use both components together
    movement_comp.velocity = input_comp.input_vector * movement_comp.max_speed
```

### Component Naming Convention

```
c_<name>_component.gd

Examples:
- c_movement_component.gd
- c_input_component.gd
- c_jump_component.gd
- c_floating_component.gd
```

### System Naming Convention

```
s_<name>_system.gd

Examples:
- s_movement_system.gd
- s_input_system.gd
- s_jump_system.gd
- s_floating_system.gd
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I have to use ECS for everything?

**A:** No! Use ECS for:
- Things that need to be mixed and matched (movement, jumping, floating)
- Things that appear on multiple entity types (health, damage, inventory)
- Complex gameplay systems (combat, AI, status effects)

Don't use ECS for:
- One-off UI elements (pause menu button)
- Simple scripts (camera follow, door open/close)
- Things that never change (static scenery)

### Q: Why can't components just do their own logic?

**A:** They could, but then:
- You can't turn off features without deleting components
- Hard to add new features that interact with existing ones
- Systems can't coordinate multiple components
- Testing becomes harder (need full entity setup)

### Q: What if I need to access a component from another component?

**A:** You don't! Components should NEVER talk to each other directly. Instead:
1. Systems read from multiple components
2. Systems coordinate the interaction
3. Systems write results back to components

**Example:**
```gdscript
# WRONG - Component talking to component
# In C_MovementComponent:
func process_tick(delta):
    var input_comp = get_input_component()
    velocity = input_comp.input_vector * max_speed  # NO!

# RIGHT - System coordinates
# In S_MovementSystem:
func process_tick(delta):
    var movement_comp = # ...
    var input_comp = movement_comp.get_input_component()
    movement_comp.velocity = input_comp.input_vector * movement_comp.max_speed  # YES!
```

### Q: Can I have multiple systems processing the same component?

**A:** Yes! That's a strength of ECS!

**Example:**
- `S_MovementSystem` moves based on input
- `S_GravitySystem` applies gravity to velocity
- `S_FloatingSystem` overrides velocity when floating

All three systems work with `C_MovementComponent.velocity`!

### Q: What if my system needs to run in a specific order?

**A:** Currently, you control order by scene tree position:
1. Add systems to scene in the order you want them to run
2. Top systems run first, bottom systems run last

**Better solution (not implemented yet):** See the refactor recommendations for system execution ordering.

### Q: How do I debug ECS?

**A:** Several ways:
1. **Print component data:**
   ```gdscript
   print("Velocity: ", movement_comp.velocity)
   ```

2. **Use debug snapshots:**
   ```gdscript
   # In floating component:
   print(floating_comp._debug_snapshot)
   ```

3. **Check registered components:**
   ```gdscript
   var manager = get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("ecs_manager")[0]
   var floating_components = manager.get_components("C_FloatingComponent")
   print("Found ", floating_components.size(), " floating components")
   ```

4. **Breakpoints in systems:**
   Set breakpoints in system `process_tick()` to inspect component state

---

## Summary

ECS is like **LEGO for game code**:

- **Entities** = Complete toys (player, enemies, objects)
- **Components** = LEGO pieces (movement, jump, float, input)
- **Systems** = Instructions (how to move, how to jump, how to float)
- **M_ECSManager** = Instruction booklet (tracks all pieces)

**The Pattern:**
1. Create components (data pieces)
2. Create systems (logic processors)
3. Add components to entities in scene
4. Systems automatically process components every frame

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Mix and match features like LEGO
- ✅ Easy to test (small pieces)
- ✅ Easy to add features (new component + system)
- ✅ Easy to remove features (delete component)
- ✅ Easy to understand (clear separation)

**Remember:**
- Components = Data only (no logic!)
- Systems = Logic only (no state!)
- Components register automatically
- Systems query every frame
- One manager per scene
