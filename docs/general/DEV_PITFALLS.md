# Developer Pitfalls

- **Lambda closures cannot reassign outer scope variables**: GDScript lambdas capture variables by reference but **cannot reassign them**. Writing `var x = 1; var f = func(): x = 2` will not modify the outer `x`. **Solution**: Use mutable containers like Arrays or Dictionaries. Example: `var result: Array = []; var callback = func(val): result.append(val)`. This commonly occurs when capturing action results in subscriber callbacks or signal handlers. See `state_test_us1a.gd` for a real-world example where `var action_received: Array = []` works but `var action_received: Dictionary = {}` does not.
- **Mock overrides need warning suppression**: Gut tests that subclass engine nodes often stub methods like `is_on_floor()` or `move_and_slide()`. Godot 4 treats these as warnings, and our CI escalates warnings to errors. Add `@warning_ignore("native_method_override")` to those stubs to keep tests loading.
- **Always register fixtures with GUT autofree**: Every node you instantiate in a test (managers, entities, components, fake bodies, etc.) must be queued through `autofree()`/`autofree_context()` so the runner releases them. Forgetting this leaks children and leaves failing cleanup warnings even when assertions pass.
- **Always add explicit types when pulling Variants**: Helpers such as `C_InputComponent.get_move_vector()` or `Time.get_ticks_msec()` return Variants. Define locals with `: Vector2`, `: float`, etc., instead of relying on inference, otherwise the parser fails with "typed as Variant" errors.
- **Annotate Callable results**: `Callable.call()` and similar helpers also return Variants. When reducers or action handlers return dictionaries, capture them with explicit types (e.g., `var next_state: Dictionary = root.call(...)`) so tests load without Variant inference errors.
- **Respect tab indentation in scripts**: Godot scripts under `res://` expect tabs. Mixing spaces causes parse errors that look unrelated to the actual change, so configure your editor accordingly before editing `.gd` files.
- **No C-style ternaries**: GDScript 4.5 rejects `condition ? a : b`. Use the native `a if condition else b` form and keep payload normalization readable.
- **Keep component discovery consistent**: Decoupled components (e.g., `C_MovementComponent`, `C_JumpComponent`, `C_RotateToInputComponent`, `C_AlignWithSurfaceComponent`) now auto-discover their peers, but components that still export NodePaths for scene nodes (landing indicator markers, floating raycasts, etc.) require those paths to be wired. Mixing patterns silently disables behaviour and breaks tests.
- **Reset support timers after jumps**: When modifying jump logic, remember to clear support/apex timers just like `C_JumpComponent.on_jump_performed()` does. Forgetting this can enable double jumps that tests catch.
- **Second-order tuning must respect clamped limits**: While tweaking response/damping values, verify they still honour `max_turn_speed_degrees` and `max_speed`. Oversight here reintroduces overshoot regressions covered by rotation/movement tests.
 - **ECS components require an entity root**: `M_ECSManager` associates components to entities by walking ancestors and picking the first node whose name starts with `E_`. If a component is not under such a parent, registration logs `push_error("M_ECSManager: Component <Name> has no entity root ancestor")` and the component is not tracked for entity queries. In tests and scenes, create an entity node (e.g., `var e := Node.new(); e.name = "E_Player"; e.add_child(component)`).
 - **Registration is deferred; yield a frame**: `ECSComponent._ready()` uses `call_deferred("_register_with_manager")`. After adding a manager/component, `await get_tree().process_frame` before asserting on registration (`get_components(...)`) or entity tracking to avoid race conditions.
 - **Required settings block registration**: Components like `C_JumpComponent`, `C_MovementComponent`, `C_FloatingComponent`, and `C_AlignWithSurfaceComponent` validate that their `*Settings` resources are assigned. Missing settings produce a `push_error("<Component> missing settings; assign an <Resource>.")` and skip registration. Wire default `.tres` in scenes, or set `component.settings = RS_*Settings.new()` in tests.
 - **Input.mouse_mode changes may need a frame**: When toggling cursor lock/visibility rapidly (e.g., calling `toggle_cursor()` twice), yield a frame between calls in tests to let `Input.mouse_mode` settle on headless runners. Example: `manager.toggle_cursor(); await get_tree().process_frame; manager.toggle_cursor(); await get_tree().process_frame`.
- **Camera-relative forward uses negative Z**: Our input vector treats `Vector2.UP` (`y = -1`) as forward. When converting to camera space (see `S_MovementSystem`), multiply the input’s Y by `-1` before combining with `cam_forward`, otherwise forward/backward movement inverts.
