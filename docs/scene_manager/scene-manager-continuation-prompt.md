# Scene Manager Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide directs you to implement the Scene Manager feature by following the tasks outlined in the documentation in sequential order.

**Branch**: `SceneManager`
**Status**: ✅ Phase 0, 1, 2 Complete | 🚧 Phase 3 In Progress (T025-T034 complete)

---

## ✅ Phase 0: Research & Architecture Validation - COMPLETE (31/31 tasks)

**Status**: All Phase 0 tasks completed successfully
**Decision**: Approved to proceed to Phase 1

**Completed (31/31 tasks) - 100%**:
- ✅ Research documented (`research.md`) - Godot 4.5 patterns, lifecycle, performance
- ✅ Data model specified (`data-model.md`) - Complete Scene Manager contracts
- ✅ Scene restructuring validated - ECS/Redux functional, 98ms load time
- ✅ Safety analysis complete - M_StateStore modification **LOW RISK**
- ✅ R011: root_prototype.tscn created with M_StateStore AND M_CursorManager - retested successfully
- ✅ R018-R021: Camera blending prototype complete with working test scene and full documentation
- ✅ R029: Memory measurements complete with quantitative data (baseline: 22.61 MB, per-scene: ~6.91 MB, peak: 30.21 MB)

**Key Findings**:
- Performance: 98ms load time (well under 500ms UI target)
- Memory: ~6.91 MB per gameplay scene, no leaks detected
- Camera blending: Smooth Tween-based interpolation validated (0.5s duration)
- M_StateStore modification: LOW RISK (additive changes only)

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Setup - COMPLETE (2/2 tasks)

**Status**: Baseline tests established successfully
**Commit**: 6f7107f

**Completed (2/2 tasks) - 100%**:
- ✅ T001: All existing tests run successfully - 212 automated GUT tests passing
- ✅ T002: Test baseline documented in commit 6f7107f

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Foundational Scene Restructuring - COMPLETE (22/22 tasks)

**Status**: All Phase 2 tasks completed successfully
**Commits**: a2b84b9 (implementation) + 22efa65 (documentation)
**Date**: 2025-10-28

**Completed (22/22 tasks) - 100%**:
- ✅ T003-T010: Root scene created with all persistent managers and containers
- ✅ T011-T016: Gameplay scene extracted from base_scene_template.tscn
- ✅ T017-T021: Integration validated (ECS, Redux, all 212 tests passing)
- ✅ T022-T024: Main scene switched to root.tscn, game launches successfully

**Key Achievements**:
- Root scene architecture established: `scenes/root.tscn` with persistent managers
- Gameplay scene template created: `scenes/gameplay/gameplay_base.tscn`
- HUD already using `U_StateUtils.get_store()` pattern (no changes needed)
- All 212 existing tests passing (no regressions):
  * Cursor Manager: 13/13 ✅
  * ECS: 62/62 ✅
  * State: 104/104 ✅
  * Utils: 11/11 ✅
  * Unit/Integration: 12/12 ✅
  * Integration: 10/10 ✅
- Documentation updated: AGENTS.md, DEV_PITFALLS.md, scene-manager-tasks.md

**Architecture Changes**:
- `scenes/root.tscn`: Persistent managers (M_StateStore, M_CursorManager, M_SceneManager stub)
- `scenes/gameplay/gameplay_base.tscn`: Per-scene M_ECSManager, Systems, Entities, Environment
- Project main scene: `res://scenes/root.tscn`

**Next Phase**: ✅ Phase 3 Started - Continue with T035-T067

---

## 🚧 Phase 3: User Story 1 - Basic Scene Transitions - IN PROGRESS (10/43 tasks)

**Status**: Tests written, scene state slice implemented and validated
**Date Started**: 2025-10-28
**Current Task**: T035 - Test transient fields excluded from save_state

**Completed (10/43 tasks) - 23%**:
- ✅ T025-T029: All unit and integration tests written (TDD approach)
  * test_scene_reducer.gd: 10 tests
  * test_scene_registry.gd: 18 tests
  * test_m_scene_manager.gd: 23 tests
  * test_transitions.gd: 21 tests
  * test_basic_transitions.gd: 15 integration tests
- ✅ T030: RS_SceneInitialState resource created with transient field support
- ✅ T031: U_SceneReducer implemented with immutable state updates
- ✅ T032: U_SceneActions created with ActionRegistry integration
- ✅ T033: M_StateStore modified to register scene slice with transient fields
- ✅ T034: Scene reducer tests passing (10/10 ✅)

**Key Achievements**:
- Scene state slice architecture established
- Transient fields configured (`is_transitioning`, `transition_type`)
- Scene reducer follows immutable Redux patterns
- Action creators properly registered with ActionRegistry
- TDD discipline maintained throughout

**Remaining Work (33 tasks)**:
- T035-T036: Validate transient fields and existing tests
- T037-T042: Implement SceneRegistry with scene metadata
- T043-T051: Implement M_SceneManager core functionality
- T052-T058: Implement transition effects (instant, fade)
- T059-T062: Create UI scenes (main menu, settings)
- T063-T067: Integration testing and validation

**Test Status**:
- Scene reducer: 10/10 passing ✅
- SceneRegistry: 0/18 (dependencies not implemented)
- M_SceneManager: 0/23 (dependencies not implemented)
- Transitions: 0/21 (dependencies not implemented)
- Integration: 0/15 (dependencies not implemented)

**Next Steps**: Validate existing 212 tests still pass, then implement SceneRegistry

## Instructions

### 1. Review Project Foundations
- `AGENTS.md` - Project conventions and patterns
- `docs/general/DEV_PITFALLS.md` - Common mistakes to avoid
- `docs/general/SCENE_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md` - Code style requirements
- `docs/general/STYLE_GUIDE.md` - Code style requirements

### 2. Review Scene Manager Documentation
- `docs/scene_manager/scene-manager-prd.md` - Full specification (7 user stories, 112 FRs)
- `docs/scene_manager/scene-manager-plan.md` - Implementation plan with phase breakdown
- `docs/scene_manager/scene-manager-tasks.md` - Task list (237 tasks: R001-R031, T001-T206)

### 3. Understand Existing Architecture
- `scripts/managers/m_state_store.gd` - Redux store (will be modified to add scene slice)
- `scripts/state/state_handoff.gd` - State preservation utility
- `scripts/managers/m_ecs_manager.gd` - Per-scene ECS manager pattern
- `templates/base_scene_template.tscn` - Current main scene (will be restructured)

### 4. Execute Tasks in Order

Work through the tasks in `scene-manager-tasks.md` sequentially:

1. **Phase 0** (R001-R031): Research & Architecture Validation
2. **Phase 1** (T001-T002): Setup - Baseline Tests
3. **Phase 2** (T003-T024): Foundational - Scene Restructuring
4. **Phase 3** (T025-T067): User Story 1 - Basic Scene Transitions
5. **Phase 4** (T068-T079): User Story 2 - State Persistence
6. **Phase 5** (T101-T128): User Story 4 - Pause System
7. **Phase 6** (T080-T100): User Story 3 - Area Transitions
8. **Phase 7** (T129-T144): User Story 5 - Transition Effects
9. **Phase 8** (T145-T161): User Story 6 - Scene Preloading
10. **Phase 9** (T162-T177): User Story 7 - End-Game Flows
11. **Phase 10** (T178-T206): Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 5. Follow TDD Discipline

For each task:
1. Write the test first
2. Run the test and verify it fails
3. Implement the minimal code to make it pass
4. Run the test and verify it passes
5. Commit with a clear message

### 6. Track Progress **YOU MUST DO THIS - NON-NEGOTIABLE**

As you complete tasks in `scene-manager-tasks.md`:

**ONLY mark tasks [x] complete when:**
- You have completed EVERY requirement in the task description
- You have not substituted research for actual implementation
- You have not made "close enough" compromises
- You have not skipped any specified components or steps

**If you deviate from the spec:**
- Mark task [ ] incomplete
- Document the deviation clearly in the task notes
- Get explicit user approval before proceeding to next phase

**Never assume "close enough" is acceptable. Every task requirement matters.**

Additional tracking requirements:
- Update task checkboxes in `scene-manager-tasks.md` after each task
- Ensure all tests remain passing after each change
- Update any relevant documentation
- Commit regularly with descriptive messages that accurately describe what was done

---

## Critical Notes

- **Phase 0, Phase 1 & Phase 2 complete**: Research validated, baseline tests established, root scene architecture implemented
- **Phase 3 begins User Story 1**: Basic scene transitions with M_SceneManager implementation
- **No autoloads**: Use scene-tree-based discovery patterns
- **TDD is mandatory**: Write tests before implementation
- **Immutable state**: Always use `.duplicate(true)` in reducers

---

## Task Execution Order Note

Due to risk management reordering, Phase 5 (T101-T128) comes before Phase 6 (T080-T100). Follow the phase order listed above, not the task numbering.

---

## Getting Started

**Current Phase**: Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Basic Scene Transitions)

Begin with Phase 3 by reading the detailed requirements in:

- `scene-manager-plan.md` (Phase 3 section)
- `scene-manager-tasks.md` (T025-T067)
- `scene-manager-prd.md` (User Story 1)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Phase 3 implements the first user story - basic scene transitions. This includes:
- Scene state slice and reducer
- SceneRegistry for scene metadata
- M_SceneManager core functionality (transition_to, get_current_scene)
- Transition effects (instant, fade)
- Basic UI scenes (main menu, settings)
